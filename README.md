# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Master of Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to my EDA course project completed as part of the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bucharest. This project, which I led as part of a collaborative group effort, focuses on predicting a company's revenue using a comprehensive ensemble of models.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to predict company revenue based on a range of data inputs. Our approach involved several critical stages:

1. **Data Processing**: We started by cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included handling missing values, normalizing features, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**: We performed thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. This involved statistical analysis, data visualization, and feature exploration.

3. **Model Architecture Engineering**: We designed and engineered various model architectures to suit the specific characteristics of our dataset. This included experimenting with different algorithms and combining multiple models to create an ensemble approach.

4. **Parameter Tuning**: We optimized model performance through meticulous parameter tuning and validation. This process ensured that our models were well-calibrated and provided the most accurate predictions possible.

## Highlights

- **Ensemble Modeling**: Leveraged an ensemble of models to enhance predictive performance and robustness.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Conducted extensive data exploration to derive actionable insights and inform model development.
- **Collaborative Effort**: Led a team in a group project setting, demonstrating effective teamwork and project management.

This project offers valuable insights into the application of ensemble models for revenue prediction and showcases the practical implementation of EDA techniques. Whether you're a fellow student or a professional interested in advanced data analysis methods, this project provides a deep dive into EDA and predictive modeling.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to gain a deeper understanding of our approach and findings.
